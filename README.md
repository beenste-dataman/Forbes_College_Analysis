# Forbes_College_Analysis
A basic analysis using :America’s Top College Rankings (Forbes,2019) https://www.kaggle.com/chris95cam/forbes-americas-top-colleges-2019?select=ForbesAmericasTopColleges2019.csv

I will be using an open source dataset, compiled by Forbes, which analyzes the rankings of the top 650 colleges in the United States. This dataset provides a broad and accurate view of multiple data points that give a clear view of the quality of education provided by these colleges. Locations, rankings, grant funds used, student/alumni populations, and tuition costs are provided in this dataset. My goal is to use these rankings to provide insight to the overall value provided by institutions of the analyzed category (for each hypothesis). A specific focus on public versus private institutions will be maintained. Multiple correlations between data points will be examined to make these observations. The referenced value will be examined with the students and their family as the audience. Students and their families are the ‘clients’ of a college, and I would like to provide insights that can be referenced by the schools, of the referenced category, to attract those clients. This data is intended to be used to attract future students to the value provided by institutions of a certain category. This data is intended to be categorical and not institution specific.
